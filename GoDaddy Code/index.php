<h2>Disruptive Innovation</h2>
<p>
Alexapath is disrupting traditional microscopic imaging by turning smartphones into medical diagnostic and imaging tools at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.
Traditional telepathology methods have relied on over-priced legacy solutions, with costs wavering between $20,000 to $230,000. 
Our patented technology offers a portable, rapid, and cost-effective solution.

<p>
  mWSI or mobile whole slide imaging is our patented method of acquiring multiple panoramic images to obtain a single composite image of a biological specimen. The mWSI contains an image pyramid where the screener can zoom in on images. Simply use the pinch gesture on a mobile device, or the zoomify viewer on the Alexapath website. The mWSI system converts any microscope into a smart phone that can digitize medical slides at resolutions up to 40x objective magnification.

<a href="http://www.teamlivelonger.com/" target="_blank"><img src="./images/teamlivelonger.png"></a><b>Team Live Longer</b> is an initiative dedicated to using technology to improve health outcomes in low resource environments. Doctors and lab technicians in Haiti will used Alexapath&#39;s life-saving technology to prepare and send PAP smear slides to the Association Medicine Haiti a l&#39;Etranger (AMHE) for diagnosis. 
Haitian women have the highest rate of mortality from cervical cancer in the world, with 54 per 100,000 women dying from the disease every year. Long waits for test results are all too common in a country of 10 million with only 5 pathologists. Alexapath&#39;s mWSI technology saves lives by providing healthcare personnel with access to pathologists worldwide, substantially decreasing the wait for test results, and in turn, increasing survival rates.
